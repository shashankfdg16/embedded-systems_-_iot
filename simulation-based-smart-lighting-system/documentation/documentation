# Simulation-Based Smart Lighting System

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic embedded systems and IoT concept using a simulation platform. The system automatically controls lighting based on ambient light conditions.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand sensor interfacing, simple control logic, and automation using a simulated embedded system environment.

## Components Used
- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- LED
- Resistor
- Virtual microcontroller
- Online simulator (Tinkercad / Wokwi)

## Working Principle
The LDR senses the surrounding light intensity and provides an analog input to the controller. When the light intensity falls below a defined threshold, the LED is turned ON. When the light intensity is above the threshold, the LED remains OFF.

## Implementation
The system logic is implemented using a simple control program that continuously reads the sensor value and compares it with a predefined threshold to control the LED output.

## Applications
- Automatic street lighting
- Smart home lighting
- Energy-saving lighting systems

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic understanding of embedded system operation and sensor-based automation using simulation tools.
