# Simulation-Based Smart Lighting System

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simulation-based embedded systems and IoT application that automatically controls lighting based on ambient light intensity.

## Objective
To understand basic embedded systems concepts such as sensor interfacing, automation logic, and system behavior using online simulation tools.

## Working Principle
A light sensor measures the surrounding light level and provides input to the controller. When the detected light intensity falls below a predefined threshold, the light is turned ON. When sufficient light is present, the light is turned OFF.

## Tools Used
- Online simulators (Tinkercad, Wokwi)
- Light sensor (LDR)
- Virtual microcontroller
- LED

## Applications
- Smart home lighting
- Automatic street lights
- Energy-efficient buildings
