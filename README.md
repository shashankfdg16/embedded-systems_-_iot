# embedded-systems_&_iot
Practical IoT and embedded systems projects demonstrating sensor interfacing, automation, and system design.

## 📘 About
This repository contains hands-on embedded systems and IoT mini projects developed using sensors, microcontrollers, and simulation platforms. The focus is on understanding core concepts such as sensor interfacing, automation, and basic system design.

## 🔧 Tools & Platforms
- Microcontrollers (generic / simulated)
- Sensors (LDR, temperature, motion, etc.)
- Simulation platforms (Tinkercad, Wokwi)

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Smart Lighting System
An automated lighting system that turns a light ON or OFF based on ambient light intensity using a light sensor.
